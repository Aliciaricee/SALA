# SALA - Spectrum Actiwatch Light Analysis
A suite of tools to work with light data from Philips Spectrum Plus (and perhaps other Philips watches?).
Takes data exported in CSV format from Philips Actiware and produces additional analyses

First run the by person notebook to generate summary data in parquet files. These files are then loaded by the other notebooks to do those analyses
